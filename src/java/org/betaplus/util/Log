It also supports agencies and organisations which engage in research and programs for prevention and education. Where possible the LGA ensures: Awareness of pathological gambling to the general public; Adequate protection for minors and vulnerable persons; That gambling is conducted in accordance with regulation to prevent crime and prevent players from being exploited. Measures taken by the LGA The social perspective is of outmost priority to the LGA. Measures to combat gambling addiction and protect vulnerable players are enshrined in all gaming legislation. Protecting the Minors Part III of the ‘Lotteries and Other Games Act, 2001’ states that any person selling any game to person under the age of eighteen years shall be guilty of an offence.  In the case of the current national lottery license persons under the age of sixteen cannot be sold National Lottery Games. Also, according to article 26 of the ‘Gaming Act, 1998’; a Maltese citizen under the age of 25 is prohibited to enter a casino. Self-barring Casinos must offer a self-barring opportunity to players who feel that for a stipulated time (6months-1year) he/she will not be allowed to enter any casino. (Article 26 of the Gaming Act,1998). The Commercial Bingo (Tombola) Regulations and the Gaming Devices regulations also contain similar provisions. This helps the gambler to recover from his addiction and recoup his losses. Alcohol/Drugs Any person who appears to be under the influence of alcohol or a drug or is acting in a disorderly manner will not be allowed to enter a casino, bingo hall and refrained from buying any lottery tickets. Any person who is subject to any means of gaming should be in a good state of mind and mental condition.

It is regulated under the provisions of the Remote Gaming Regulations (L.N. 176/04). The sector dynamics of remote gaming coupled with the technological convergence created the need for a remodelled regulatory framework. The first on-line betting in Malta in the 2000, was established under the Public Lotto Ordinance (L.N. 34 of 2000), to regulate offshore betting offices. Since then LGA has developed its methodologies to regulate the procedures of remote gaming operations, and in April 2004, revamped Remote Gaming Regulations were published. Malta became the first EU member state to regulate Remote Gaming. The LGA regulatory regime aims to be both technology neutral and game neutral – encompassing any type of gaming using a means of distance communication (including internet, digital TV, mobile phone technology, telephone and fax). Any remote game which can be securely managed under LGA regulations will be considered for licensing. Under the Remote Gaming Regulations, 2004 there are four classes by which an operator may be licensed. In March 2005, the Malta Remote Gaming Council was launched.  This Council brings together all our remote gaming licensees, giving them a great opportunity to meet new challenges backed by the inherent advantages of collective effort.  LGA also launched an on-line forum aiming to create an on going discussion between all stakeholders, ISP providers, legal and financial representatives in the Malta remote gaming industry.  For more information kindly visit the website www.mrgc.org.mt   Lotteries and Gaming Authority.

Prior to February, 2004, all National Lottery games fell under the responsibility of the Public Lotto Department. In February, 2004 Maltco Lotteries Limited was awarded an exclusive license to operate all the National Lottery games. The license was valid for seven years with an additional year in case of non renewal due to a Public Call. In October 2011 an international public tender for the concession rights of the National Lottery Games, namely Lotto, Super 5 and the Grand Lottery was published, with two bidders responding to such a call for tenders. Maltco Lotteries Limited was the successful bidder and was awarded a 10 year concession by the Government of Malta and a 10 year licence granted by the Lotteries and Gaming Authority on the 27th June 2012. The second National Lottery licence is valid as from the 5th July 2012.   The Lotteries and Gaming Authority regulates the operations of Maltco Lotteries Limited as the National Lottery Licensee and collects gaming tax from the licensee on behalf of the Government.  The National Lottery Licensee provides contributions towards the Good Causes Fund and the Reponsible Gaming Fund.   Lotteries and Gaming Authority.

It is regulated under the provisions of the Remote Gaming Regulations (L.N. 176/04). The sector dynamics of remote gaming coupled with the technological convergence created the need for a remodelled regulatory framework. The first on-line betting in Malta in the 2000, was established under the Public Lotto Ordinance (L.N. 34 of 2000), to regulate offshore betting offices. Since then LGA has developed its methodologies to regulate the procedures of remote gaming operations, and in April 2004, revamped Remote Gaming Regulations were published. Malta became the first EU member state to regulate Remote Gaming. The LGA regulatory regime aims to be both technology neutral and game neutral – encompassing any type of gaming using a means of distance communication (including internet, digital TV, mobile phone technology, telephone and fax). Any remote game which can be securely managed under LGA regulations will be considered for licensing. Under the Remote Gaming Regulations, 2004 there are four classes by which an operator may be licensed. In March 2005, the Malta Remote Gaming Council was launched.  This Council brings together all our remote gaming licensees, giving them a great opportunity to meet new challenges backed by the inherent advantages of collective effort.  LGA also launched an on-line forum aiming to create an on going discussion between all stakeholders, ISP providers, legal and financial representatives in the Malta remote gaming industry.  For more information kindly visit the website www.mrgc.org.mt   Lotteries and Gaming Authority.

Although most of the general public usually do not take any due account of such suspicious lottery wins, however, a small percentage of the public who may be vulnerable to such communications may fall in the trap of genuinely taking such ‘phantom’ wins seriously. If you receive a "prize notification" from a suspicious lottery: Don't respond to the emails or sms received. Don't pay any money in advance to collect a prize. Don't reveal your identity. Don't reveal your bank account number or credit card details. Report such suspicious lotteries to the Lotteries and Gaming Authority or to the Police. How to identify ‘suspicious’ lotteries You should be suspicious of messages received of a win, when the individual knows that he/she have never participated in a lottery. You should be suspicious of messages received of a win, when you are asked to deposit a sum in a bank account in order to process your win, pay for bank transfer charges or for ‘shipping and handling charges’ You should be suspicious of messages received of a win, when you are asked to disclose your credit card details or bank account for the deposit of the win, in a lottery that you have never participated in. The General Public is informed that they should play with operators who are duely licensed by a reputable authority such as the Lotteries and Gaming Authority. Lotteries and Gaming Authority.

News  |  Events  |  Careers  |  Legal Lotteries & Gaming Authority SEARCH SITEMAP CONTACT US Home About Us Gaming Sectors Legislation Resources Responsible Gaming Malta Licencees About Us Corporate Profile LGA Board Structure of the LGA Financial Statements & Annual Reports Corporate Profile The gaming industry has transcended the limitations of brick and mortar casinos and high street betting shops, relying evermore on high tech innovations that have increased player interactivity and made it possible to deliver gaming anytime, anywhere and on any telecommunication device. For this reason gaming is also fraught with difficulties when it comes to define its conceptual and legal parameters. Regulators are finding it increasingly important to be backed by an effective legislative instrument and to have a sound corporate structure that enables them to take on new challenges. The enactment of the Lotteries and Other Games Act, 2001 aimed to bring all gaming activities, with the exception of land-based casinos, under one comprehensive legislative instrument. The Act vested the Authority with a wide array of powers, thereby providing the necessary tools to implement effective regulation. Our aims: Protecting minors and vulnerable persons; Safeguarding players' rights; Promoting responsible gaming in a safe environment; Ensuring the integrity of games and gaming devices; Keeping gaming free from criminal activities. Our Objectives: Consolidate all the regulatory functions relating to gaming activities; Operate a successful and a fully integrated Authority; Support the industry and technological innovation; Provide authoritative and accessible information; Provide a one-stop-shop for licensing. Our Activities: Conducting research on various aspects of gaming; Granting licences relating to gaming and lotteries; Monitoring licensed gaming; Collecting gaming taxes on behalf of the Government; Supporting good causes; Ensuring that the sector contributes to the country's development.
